# ENE223

The objectif of this project is to develop a Fully Implicit Simulator to simulate flow in Porous Media/Reservoirs:

Before showing the equations, let’s first go over the assumptions of the developed model:
• No capillary effects.
• Oil viscosity is constant (It can be easily added to the simulator because it is treated
  the same way as the gas viscosity)
• Porosity is constant.
• Valid hypothesises for the well model development (Radial-flow, steady-state or pseudosteady-state, fully penetrating, No interference with boundaries or other wells)


The results from different simulations will be presented and compared to the ones from ECLIPSE software.
