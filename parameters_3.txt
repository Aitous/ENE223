####This a file describing the different parameters needed to run the simulation####

####
#Pinit: initial reservoir pressure

#Cr: rock compressibility
#Kx: permeability in the x direction, unit md same for Ky and Kz. if _h is added at the end is to show that we have homogeneous perm.
#Phi: rock porosity 

#mu: fluid viscosity in Cp
#rho_f: fluid density in lbm/ft^3
#Cf: fluid compressibility in psi^-1

#Lx: reservoir length in the x direction in feet, same for y and z directions
#grid_dims = dimensions of the grid (number of cells in the x direction followed by the number of cells in y direction and then z direction)

#position: well position, x first and y second
#rate: production or injection rate in STB/day
#BHP: the BHP control limit
#diam: is the well diameter
#control: BHP or Rate depending on the type of control.
